Contributions are welcome. The goal of this project is to provide a clean,
reproducible pipeline from Lovdata’s public datasets to a normalized,
machine-readable corpus.

## Basics

- Python 3.11+ (3.12 is fine).
- Use a virtual environment.
- Dependencies are in `requirements.txt`.

Setup:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
